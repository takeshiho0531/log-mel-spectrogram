Incremental Synthesis Report Summary:

1. Incremental synthesis run: no

   Reason for not running incremental synthesis : Design change found in an area of the design that prevents previous synthesis information being used


INFO: [Synth 8-7130] Flow is switching to default flow due to incremental criteria not met. If you would like to alter this behaviour and have the flow terminate instead, please set the following parameter config_implementation {autoIncr.Synth.RejectBehavior Terminate}
